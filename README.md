a place to hold some code for barnsley fern chaos game


https://infogalactic.com/info/Barnsley_fern

using infogalatic as the GFW has never been so bad.

my home isp is blocking github and our VPN is useless, but i can access my github pages, weird.

My cellular data isp hasn't blocked github but is blocking github pages go figure

so I am able to create a wifi hotspot to create this repository.

I have two processing files.  one showing the weighted probabilities of the barnsley fern and the the second

is the fern itself.  

I have followed the coding trains video, coding challenge 108, from biliblil
